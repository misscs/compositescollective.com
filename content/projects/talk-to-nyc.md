## A better world is possible

Societies shaped by citizen participation and emerging technologies are no longer stories of science fiction. These are possible realities and there are many successful, active experiments across the world

* Berlin engages at-risk youth to redesign city spaces using the video-game minecraft
* Taipei uses participatory democracy models to draft digital legislation
* Madrid croudsources proposals from citizens and executes them based on citizen votes

## Current Challenge

What if the future of NYC was crafted by the citizens of NYC? With the power of AI and modern Web technologies, we believe that this is absolutely possible! 

Many New Yorkers want to participate in city governance but it is hard. Information of about local governance activities (e.g. community board meetings) is hard to find and even if people have the information, in order to participate, they must attend meetings that last for hours, where only the loudest voices are heard. 

On the flip side, city officials are overwhelmed. The size of New York City is enormous (each district averages 160,000 peolple!), understanding and tackling the concerns of the community is very difficult. There is no good platform for them to engage with citizens, at scale.

## The Experiment

[Talk to NYC](talkto.nyc) is a community-powered, on/offline platform to forge stronger connections between NYC citizens and city decision makers. We view this platform as an adaptable and reproducible model for future democracies in cities world-wide.

### The Talk to NYC platform:

* crowdsources concerns and ideas directly from the community using AI surveying tool, Pol.is
* promotes open knowledge, data and tools
* promotes transparency and holds representatives accountable by acting as the community watchdog
* creates spaces for government and citizens to come together for deliberation and action (both online and offline)
* organizes training camps for community learning and development 

## The Outcome

We launched Talk to NYC in districts 1 and 2, during the primary elections in 2017.

* we used AI tool Pol.is to crowdsource citizen concerns
* we then used this information to question district council candidates at debates and in-person interviews
* when we interviewed the candidated we also questioned them on their views on participation models and introduced them to particpatory tools
* we helped interested candidates use these technology tools to hear the concerns of their constituents and generate discussion on specific issues (e.g. transportation issues)
* we made community partners
* we made organizational partners
* worked with district members to strategize a people's repository for housing-related issues


## Where are we going next?

In January 2018 we will be building infastructure that will enable us to expand the Talk to NYC platform and tackle city-wide concerns and issues (e.g. the L train shutdown)

The first step we will undertake is to create a detailed manual of the AI-mediated civic deliberation process, vTaiwan. We will then adapt and use this method to tackle concerns and issues in New York City.
