## WHY WE ARE DOING THIS

We are working to test and implement successful models of participatory democracy from around the world in New York City.

In collaboration with open government vanguard, BetaNYC, we are designing and conducting community meetings to craft NYC's digital future. Our civic deliberation methods are adaptations of prototypes developed in Taiwan adapted for New York City context.

## THE EXPERIMENT

In 2013, NYC-based civic organization [BetaNYC]() coordinated community meetings that lead to the development of [The People’s Roadmap for a Digital New York City](). Co-written by NYC’s civic technology & open data community, the document advocates around principles of open government, smarter communities, economic mobility, education, and accessible technology practices.

The People's Roadmap served to guide the 2014 incoming administration into community digital services and in 4 years: 14 of the 34 proposals have been introduced as legislation in City Council; 7 have become laws, and 9 have gone on to become public-private partnerships.

In January 2018, NYC will have a newly elected city government. In anticipation of this change, BetaNYC is working directly with NYC communities across the five burroughs to outline NYC’s digital future for the next 4 years.

[Composites Collective](http://compositescollective.com) is collaborating with BetaNYC to design and action online and offline deliberation processes that can effectively engage community members in creating the 2018 People's Roadmap for NYC's digital future.

## THE OUTCOME

BetaNYC and Composites Collective are successfully adapting and using on/offline participation tools and deliberation methods from the vTaiwan process and the deliberation procedure of Lu Chia Hua to gather citizen concerns and solutions for the 2018 People's Roadmap.

The project is currently in the information gathering phase.

In this phase:

1. Information about the 2013 People's Roadmap is distributed through onine and offline channels
2. F2F deliberation sessions are held in public forums, community events, and workshops, in all five boroughs of the City
3. Information generated at the F2F events are used to structure online discussions conducted via Slack and open source discussion platform, [Discourse]().
