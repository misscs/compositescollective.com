## WHY WE ARE DOING THIS

_This this should focus on explaining why we care about facilitaiton and why this project is important in current news/conversation landscape_

## THE EXPERIMENT

In fact, many people in the West are individually inspired to localize this process to their own cities, regions, and nations; as we’ve found each other and sought to share information and best practices, a network has organically formed and recently chosen a name for itself -- “vNetwork.”

## WHERE ARE WE GOING NEXT?

We are going to visit the Public Digital Innovation Space (PDIS in 2018 to create a detailed manual of the  vTaiwan civic deliberation process. Our aim is to capture video and translate materials currently in Mandarin to English (and eventually Spanish and other languages).

We are also working towards convening a Facilitation Fest in the New York area at the end of 2018 to celebrate and share facilitation traditions from diverse fields including governance, law, urban planning, and further grow the community of practice around the vTaiwan process for crafting legislation which includes simultaneous facilitation for in-person & remote stakeholder meetings, structured conversation, and open source AI-mediated machine learning consensus building.
